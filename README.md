# USB Fan Controller
There are many USB fan controllers on sale, but none of them allow you to PWM 2-pin fans, as far as I am aware. This controller implements a compatible and widely supported USB serial port interface and allows you to control fans with it. It also supports 1-Wire sensors for temperature measurement.
